when there is no toolbar and system action bar, to avoid the view 和 status bar 重叠
可以加上： android:fitsSystemWindows="true"

searchView will auto show the keyboard when it is not isIconified
want the keyboard hide => searchView.setIconified(false)
when searchView belong to an icon, it will become an icon
when not belong to an icon, it will still a search bar

In doInBackground method, do not use object in UI thread => may lead to thread not safe
=> same to all multi-thread code
